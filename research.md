I work on a variety of problems in high-redshift astrophysics, other areas of astronomy, astrostatistics, and machine 
learning.  My research is inspired by astrophysical phenomena whose explanation has been cast into doubt, either by new 
theoretical ideas or new observations.  I am a founding member of the [Cosmic Dawn Center](https://dawn.nbi.ku.dk), a Danish 
National Research Foundation Center of Excellence hosted by the Niels Bohr Institute and Danish Technical University.  I also 
run an [undergraduate research program](https://dawn.nbi.ku.dk/events/surfdawn/) bringing undergraduates to Denmark 
every summer.
